# MaxHangTime
My Capstone project for Ada Developer's Academy C6 was a React Native iOS app for Rock Climbers who want to record max hang times while hangboard training. My main goal was to create a mobile app as I've enjoyed working on mobile apps in my previous career as a product manager. I wanted to get more experience with Javascript (ES6), and React Native had appeal as it would be much easier to port an app to Android in the future. 

# Product Plan 
[Product Plan](https://gist.github.com/wordkarin/4427e9ed8ef2643698635147efd2da3c)
The product plan contains a Problem Statement describing the problem MaxHangTime would solve: training is boring, customers need motivation to train - seeing progress is motivation. Product plan also contains Market Research, including competitive analysis - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and non-app solutions), and research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.

The product plan also contains User Personas, Technology selections, and Wireframes. My technologies changed as I did more research into what would work with React Native.

# Techonlogies 
Technologies actually used in this project include: 
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) 
* [Realm](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/index.html) (local data storage solution) 
* [D3](https://github.com/d3/) 
* [react-native-art](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Libraries/ART)
* [react-native-swipeout](https://github.com/dancormier/react-native-swipeout)

# Tutorials 
I relied heavily on tutorials to learn the different tecnologies that I ended up using in my app. Here's a couple:
